title:
    The history about C++

content:
    C++ has a long hisotry for it was invented before the 2000 years.
Suppose that C++ is popular at the 2000 years, but C++ doesn't have the best practice in anytime of history.

Let me clarify a concept, although computer tech used to evolve very fast.
But always having restrictions to bring in new tech.
You may frequently listen a word "compatibility", in fact, it strongly influenced the electronic products to update.

The reason why we take in "compatibility" is because the cost of the comprehensive updating is too high.

Such as C++ or any popular language cannot avoid a truth is that it shouldn't destory the workflow of legacy code when it push a new standard.

This means we can do addition on standard, rather than do substraction.
